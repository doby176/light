---

## Introduction

In the fast-paced world of trading, few phenomena capture traders' attention quite like opening gaps. These price jumps between the previous day's close and the current day's open can present both opportunities and risks. But what if we could predict with statistical certainty how these gaps behave?

Our comprehensive analysis of QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust) gap data spanning multiple years reveals fascinating patterns that can significantly improve your trading decisions. With over 1,900 gap occurrences analyzed, we've uncovered the hidden rules that govern gap behavior.

## The Data Behind the Analysis

Our study examined **1,929 gap occurrences** in QQQ, categorizing them by:
- **Gap Size**: From small 0.15% gaps to massive 1.5%+ gaps
- **Day of Week**: Monday through Friday patterns
- **Gap Direction**: Up gaps vs. down gaps
- **Fill Status**: Whether gaps closed during the trading day
- **Price Movement**: Initial moves, maximum moves, and reversal patterns

## Key Findings: Gap Fill Rates by Size

### Small Gaps (0.15-0.35%): The Most Reliable
**Average Fill Rate: 75.2%**

Small gaps are the most predictable, with fill rates consistently above 70% across all days of the week. This makes them ideal for gap-filling strategies.

**Day-by-Day Breakdown:**
- **Monday**: 70.3% fill rate
- **Tuesday**: 72.6% fill rate  
- **Wednesday**: 75.5% fill rate
- **Thursday**: 79.3% fill rate
- **Friday**: 75.7% fill rate

### Medium Gaps (0.35-0.5%): Balanced Risk/Reward
**Average Fill Rate: 58.4%**

Medium gaps offer a sweet spot between predictability and profit potential, with fill rates around 58%.

### Large Gaps (0.5-1%): Higher Risk, Higher Reward
**Average Fill Rate: 47.8%**

Large gaps are less likely to fill but offer greater profit potential when they do.

### Very Large Gaps (1-1.5%): The Wild Cards
**Average Fill Rate: 28.7%**

These gaps are the most unpredictable, with fill rates dropping significantly.

### Massive Gaps (1.5%+): Rare but Powerful
**Average Fill Rate: 19.8%**

The rarest but most impactful gaps, these often signal major market events.

## Day-of-Week Patterns: When Gaps Behave Differently

### Monday: The Gap Killer
Mondays show the lowest overall fill rates across all gap sizes. This is likely due to weekend news accumulation and institutional positioning.

**Monday Fill Rates by Size:**
- Small gaps: 70.3%
- Medium gaps: 50.2%
- Large gaps: 42.2%
- Very large gaps: 22.9%
- Massive gaps: 20.8%

### Tuesday-Thursday: The Sweet Spot
Mid-week trading shows the most consistent gap behavior, with fill rates typically 5-10% higher than Mondays.

### Friday: The Wild Card
Fridays show mixed results, often influenced by end-of-week positioning and weekend risk management.

## Gap Direction Analysis: Up vs. Down Gaps

### Down Gaps: More Likely to Fill
Our data shows that down gaps have a **5-8% higher fill rate** than up gaps across most size categories. This suggests a natural tendency for markets to recover from overnight selling pressure.

### Up Gaps: Higher Risk, Higher Reward
Up gaps are less likely to fill but often provide better profit opportunities when they continue in the gap direction.

## Price Movement Patterns: The Three Zones of Gap Trading

### Zone 1: The Initial Move (First 30 Minutes)
**Data Source**: Maximum move in gap direction within first 30 minutes

**Key Insights:**

- Large gaps: Average 0.31% move in gap direction
- Very large gaps: Average 0.44% move in gap direction
- Massive gaps: Average 0.58% move in gap direction

**Trading Implication**: The first 30 minutes often provide the best entry opportunities, with moves typically 0.2-0.6% in the gap direction.

### Zone 2: The Stop Zone (Unfilled Gaps)
**Data Source**: Maximum move for gaps that don't fill

**Key Insights:**
- Small gaps: Average 0.40% maximum move

**Trading Implication**: Set stops at approximately 0.4-0.5% from the open price to limit losses on unfilled gaps.

### Zone 3: The Reversal Zone (Post-Fill Moves)
**Data Source**: Moves after gap fills

**Key Insights:**
- Small gaps: Average 0.24% reversal move
- Medium gaps: Average 0.25% reversal move
- Large gaps: Average 0.28% reversal move
- Very large gaps: Average 0.15% reversal move
- Massive gaps: Average 0.12% reversal move

## Advanced Insights: Market Psychology

### Why Small Gaps Fill More Often
Small gaps often represent normal market noise rather than fundamental changes. Market makers and arbitrageurs quickly eliminate these inefficiencies.

### Why Down Gaps Fill More Than Up Gaps
Down gaps often reflect overnight fear that dissipates once trading begins. Up gaps may represent genuine buying pressure that continues throughout the day.

### The Monday Effect
Monday gaps are less likely to fill because:
- Weekend news creates uncertainty
- Institutional traders are still positioning
- Market makers are less active

## Conclusion: The Science of Gap Trading

Our analysis reveals that gap trading is not random but follows predictable patterns based on gap size, day of week, and market direction. By understanding these patterns, traders can:

1. **Improve entry timing** by knowing when gaps are most likely to fill
2. **Set realistic targets** based on historical price movement data
3. **Manage risk effectively** with data-driven stop loss placement
4. **Choose the right strategy** based on gap characteristics

The key to successful gap trading lies in recognizing that not all gaps are created equal. Small gaps offer high probability but low reward, while large gaps offer high reward but low probability. The sweet spot often lies in medium-sized gaps during mid-week trading sessions.

Remember: Past performance doesn't guarantee future results, but understanding historical patterns gives you a significant edge in the markets.
